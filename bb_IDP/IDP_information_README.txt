IDP file information:

	In the tvb pipeline under tvb-ukbb/bb_IDP/ we have the following files containing IDP information but NOT values:


				list.txt :				UKBB's original list of IDPs (likely outdated) - these were generated by the original UKBB pipeline and its T1_GM_Parcellation IDPs correspond to UKBB's original ROI parcellations 


				ukbb_IDP_list.txt :		IDPs generated by the original UKBB pipeline. unlike list.txt, its T1_GM_Parcellation IDPs corresponds to the user's new ROI parcellations (PARC_LUT). this is updated by the ukbb_IDP_list_gen.py script, preferably before a subject is run so that the ukbb IDP list is complete and available for users to refer to when filling in IDPs_of_interest (currently IDPoi.txt).


				IDPs_of_interest.txt (currently IDPoi.txt) :	a user-defined list of IDPs of interest. IDPs should exist in ukbb_IDP_list. these IDPs will appear in the QC IDP report and their threshold values will be used to flag subjects for QC. these are separated into low and high priority IDPs. tvb new IDPs don't need to be added to this list because they are automatically included in the significant IDPs list		
										TODO: rename as IDPs_of_interest instead of IDPoi
										TODO: make it a json


				<dataset_name>_IDPs.txt	:		information about IDPs generated by the original UKBB pipeline as well as new IDPs generated by TVB-UKBB pipeline. this is generated by the dataset_IDP_gen.py script, only after a subject has already been run. 


				thresholds.txt :			a file containing (user-defined) threshold values for each IDP that a user wants to use to flag subjects for QC




	In each subject under <subname>/IDP_files/ we have the following files containing IDP information AND values AND threshold information:


				tvb_new_IDPs.txt :			new IDPs generated by the TVB-UKBB pipeline (IDPs not present in ukbb_IDP_list.txt)


				non_priority_IDPs.txt :		low priority IDPs of interest
				

				priority_IDPs.txt :			high priorty IDPs of interest


				significant_IDPs.txt :		tvb_new_IDPs and IDPs_of_interest
