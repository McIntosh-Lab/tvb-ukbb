The 'TVB_SchaeferTian' parcellations were created by combining the Schaefer2018 cortical parcellation with the Tian2020 subcortical parcellation.
Different granularities of these hierarchical parcellations were chosen and collapsed into a single image file. Detailed label information can be found in the associated lookup tables (*_LUT.tsv).

The following customizations were also performed:
TVB_SchaeferTian_220 & TVB_SchaeferTian_420: The 20 subcortical regions are comprised of the regions from the Tian2020 Scale 1 atlas except for the hippocampus. For hippocampus, the Scale 3 atlas was used with the hippocampal head divisions (HIP-head-m, HIP-head-l) collapsed into a single parcel (HIP-head).
TVB_SchaeferTian_436: The 36 subcortical regions are comprised of the regions from the Tian2020 Scale 2 atlas except for the hippocampus. For hippocampus, the Scale 3 atlas hippocampal divisions were used.
