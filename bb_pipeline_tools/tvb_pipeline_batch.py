"""
Python script to batch process subjects using the TVB-UK Biobank pipeline.

This script was written for old OGS/SGE systems where you can't just
submit 600 subjects and expect it to handle it properly. The script
allows you to specify a number of subjects to have running via
OGS/SGE at any given time.

Additional features of batching script:
    - Specify a number of subjects to submit to `qsub` concurrently.
    - Logs printed out in addition to printing into the terminal.
    - Resume function in the event the batch script ends abruptly.
    - Load text file with a subject name on each line and only run
        those subjects.
    - Resume from a session where the subjects were loaded in from
        a text file.
    - Marks subjects that completed successfully and subjects that
        errored out during the session.

Example setup:

    Subjects are in directory `/drive/subjects`. There's a text file,
    `/drive/subjects.txt`, containing the subject names to be run
    (one subject name per line). cd to /drive/subjects.
    In the conda env, run (on one line)

    > python <absolute_path_to_tvb-ukbb>/bb_pipeline_tools/tvb_pipeline_batch.py 
      -s . -n 3 --rotman --from-txt ../subjects.txt

    This line runs the batch script on the subject directories
    in the current directory, specifies 3 subjects to be run at
    once, and specifies the text file in the directory above the
    current one as the subject list to load in.

    Note: in this example, the logfile would be located in
          /drive/batch_2021XXXXXXXXXX (replace Xs with
          timestamp of when script was launched)
